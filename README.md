# Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of wines based on various chemical and sensory features. The dataset used for this prediction consists of red and white wine samples, each with several attributes such as acidity, alcohol content, and color intensity.


## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling numerical features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzing the distribution of wine quality.
- Visualizing relationships between different features.
- Identifying correlations and patterns in the dataset.

### 3. Model Selection

Choosing appropriate machine learning models for wine quality prediction. Some models to consider:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

### 4. Model Training

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and training the selected models on the training data.

### 5. Model Evaluation

Evaluating the models' performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error, R-squared, and classification accuracy (if treated as a classification problem).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
